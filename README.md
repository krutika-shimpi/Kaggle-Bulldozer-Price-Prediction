## Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

In this notebook, we're going through a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

### 1. Problem Definition

> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

### 2. Data
The data is downloaded from the Kaggle bluebook for bulldozers competition:

There are three main data set:

### 3. Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this Project is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices. This project was part of the Kaggle Competition and the evaluation metric was RMSLE.

**NOTE:** The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to mminimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.
